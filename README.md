# Palo-Alto-Chromebook-Identity
This is a chrome extension that will grab the ip of the chrome book and the signed in user, it will then post this to a webserver hosting php. From there the php will post the ip and username to a palo alot firewall api so that it can log the identity to match with traffic.
